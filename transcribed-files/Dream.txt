 What was your childhood dream? Well, when it was a child, my dream was to become a doctor. I was fascinated by the human body and the idea of being able to help people when they were sick or injured. As I grew older, my interest shifted a bit, but I still have lots of respect for people in the medical profession. I used to be a kind person who believes in dreams. Definitely, yes, I suppose that a dream is a wish of my heart. My hands are usually dream about what I am hoping. So, someone who is superstitious, it is good when the dreams turn into a good precursor. Which makes them feel relieved about the future. And then it is undeniable that dreams will affect life in all ways. Oh, you know, I believe in dreams and I hope that good things will happen. What is your dream job? To be honest, I want to become a director, a secretary or head up human resources. I have a passion about working in a large corporation. And I am hooked by modern facilities and working environment in a big conglomerate. I really enjoy working with people because I can communicate with them, explain their questions, and have them enjoy services as good as possible. And working with people is one of the best ways to enhance my passion.
