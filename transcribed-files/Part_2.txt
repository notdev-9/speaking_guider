 I'm going to talk about a fascinating job that I inspire me a lot. In pursuing my dream, it is an interpreter. To the best of my knowledge, an interpreter is someone who is fluent in at least two languages. It is their job to have people communicate with one another. Even though they don't have a common language by converting from one language into another. My uncle told me about his job, which is an interpreter and I extremely admire him. Then I deeply decided to step into his shoes and climb to the top of the career ladder in the future. As for me, Interbreager is an amazing job for several reasons. First thing first, it is quite well paid job because the salary could be enough to support myself and my family on daily basis. Moreover, this job brings me an immense amount of job satisfaction which makes me happy all day. I can get out being stuck in a route and get a job as an office worker. To be black and white, the quality is one to explain why this job is attracting. As long as I have a degree and experience, I could have a chance of being called for an interview. Then get a full-time job worth of competitive salaries and promotion. Yes, all you know is an ideal job that always thinks about. I know I need to burn the midnight aisle and be ready to cross the bridge when it comes to an end to achieve my goal.
